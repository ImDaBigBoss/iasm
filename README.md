# IASM

This assembler is an attempt to learn more about assembly and how machine code functions.

**Please note that this project is under development!** As such, it really is not recommended that you use this for anything serious. There are plenty of real assemblers out there, for example [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) is a good choice.

## Building

Building should be just as simple as running `make` in the root directory of this project.

## How to use

You have access to a `-h` falg as well as a very helpful `docs` folder. If you have any additional questions, please open an issue or join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/5n8ttQfSqF).
